<p style="text-align: center"> My name is Kamryn Irving, I am 19 years young and I am from a small town in Northen Maine (The County) called Washburn. Afte my freshman year of high school however I was given the oppourtunity to transfer and finish my high school career at a boarding school in Canada called Rothesay Netherwood School. I am a first year university student studying business at the University of Maine. My major is Business Undeclared and I chose it because even though I am interested in the business field I would still like to keep my options open for my future endevors. I think that the business field is really amazing in the way that you are able to pursue so many different careers and develope many different ways of thinking. What peaked my interest in business was growing up on my fathers farm and even though I fond the engineering and manual labor part of the company cool, I was was very intrigued by what is going on behind the scenes, that being our farms marketing department.I am excited start this new journey in my life and expand my knowledge in technology and business. Although it was challenging, I really enjoyed the process of making this website and learning new things that will help me stand out in the business world in the future. Welcome to my website!</center></p>
