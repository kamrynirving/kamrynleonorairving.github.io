                      <p style="text-align: center"> For me sports have always been a great release of energy or stress. Just being part of a team and learning new skills has always been fun for me. I was always good at sports but I never really stood out until I switched schools. Since sports were such a big deal at my boarding school it pushed me to work even harder which resulted in me standing out. The competive sports that I layed included, soccer, rugby, volleyball, but my favorite and the one I worked the hardest at was basketball. This hard work resulted in me being the starting point guard my sophomore, junior and senior year. Even though I put in a lot of work, I still faced a lot of challenges. At the end of my sophomore year I began having shoulder problems that eventually resulted in surgery the summer before my senior year. But the injury that affected me the most were my concussions. By the beginning of my final highschool basketball season I had recieved m 12th concussion deeming me unable to participate in contact sports again. This is still a hard thing for me to comprehend but I have taken up things like running and working out to compensate.
