There is nothing that makes me happier than just spending time and going on adventures with my friends. Since I did switch schools in high school I had to leave all my friends that I have been with since Pre-K. This was something that was really hard for me but paid off in the end because it put me out of my comfort zone and lead me to make some new friendships to last a life time. This made coming to University and making new friends so much easier and I am so thankful to have these people in my life.
