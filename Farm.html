                      <p style="text-align: center"> I was born and raised on a farm that has been in my family since 1936. It has been passed down generations and is currently owned my dad. It is called Irving Farms inc. This farm is such a big part of my life and I have learned so many things about the business world by growing up and working on it. It is always so nice coming home from school to this place. Being raised on this farm really made me the person I am today and I am so greatful.
